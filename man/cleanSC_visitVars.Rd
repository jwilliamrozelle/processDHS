\title{Clean and Recode Visit Variables for Service Data}
\usage{
cleanSC_visitVars(SCdata)
}
\arguments{
\item{SCdata}{A data frame containing the service consultation data, expected to include specific
variables such as provider codes, symptom codes, and survey identifiers.}
}
\value{
The modified SCdata data frame with new or transformed variables:
  - Provider qualifications and types (generalist, specialist, nurses, etc.)
  - Recoded symptom variables (cough, diarrhea, fever, etc.)
  - Visit outcome variables (outcome of consultation, referrals, etc.)
  - Additional derived metrics like symptom indices and referral statuses.
}
\description{
This function processes healthcare service visit data by recoding provider qualifications,
symptoms, and other visit-related variables based on specific survey IDs. It supports multiple
country-specific datasets by applying different recoding rules for each. It also generates new
variables indicating the type of provider, symptoms reported, and visit outcomes.

\examples{
# Assuming SCdata is loaded with the necessary survey variables
# Example usage:
SCdata <- data.frame(
  svyID = c("AF_SPA18", "HT_SPA17", "MW_SPA13"),
  providerCode = c(1, 21, 3),
  c255a = c(1, 0, 1), c255b = c(0, 1, 0), c255c = c(1, 1, 0),
  c517a = c("0900", "1000", "1100"), c517b = c("0930", "1030", "1115")
)
cleaned_data <- cleanSC_visitVars(SCdata)
