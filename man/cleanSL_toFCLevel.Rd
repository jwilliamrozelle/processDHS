\title{Clean Service Level Data and Calculate Facility-Level Statistics}
\usage{
cleanSL_toFCLevel(SLdata)
}
\arguments{
\item{SLdata}{A data frame containing service level data. This dataset must
include a column named `svyID` with identical survey identifiers for all
rows, and ideally includes an `inv_id` that can be used as `facID` if `facID`
is not present.}
}
\value{
Returns a data frame with facility-level aggregated statistics.
  The return includes columns for medical doctors, nurses, surgeons, and other
  specialized services, aggregated by facility. Additionally, it merges count
  data on various services provided based on specific criteria.
}
\description{
This function processes a dataset (`SLdata`) that contains service level data,
ensuring it contains a `svyID` column with identical values across observations.
It then computes various facility-level statistics based on the survey ID (svyID)
and other criteria defined within the function for multiple survey configurations.
The function groups data by `facID` and calculates counts of different provider
types and services provided. It merges these counts into a final dataset.

\examples{
# Assuming SLdata is your dataset loaded with appropriate columns:
result <- cleanSL_toFCLevel(SLdata)
