\title{Extract and Clean Maternal Mortality Data}
\usage{
mmExtractClean(IRdata)
}
\arguments{
\item{IRdata}{A dataframe containing individual-level survey data including maternal mortality indicators.}
}
\value{
A dataframe of cleaned and processed sibling (sister) level data with variables indicating 
maternal mortality risks, ages, and outcomes, among others.
}
\description{
This function takes a dataframe containing maternal mortality data and performs a series of 
operations to clean and organize this data. It generates a list of variables related to maternal 
mortality (mm variables), subsets these indicators from the input data, processes sibling information 
including calculating ages and determining risk factors, and finally returns a cleaned dataframe 
focused on sister-level information regarding maternal mortality risks and outcomes.
}
\examples{
# Assuming 'IRdata.list$MW7' is your dataset with maternal mortality indicators
IRdata <- IRdata.list$MW7
cleaned_data <- mmExtractClean(IRdata)
}
