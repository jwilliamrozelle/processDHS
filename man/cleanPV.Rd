\title{Clean and Enhance Provider Data}
\usage{
cleanPV(PVdata)
}
\arguments{
\item{PVdata}{A dataframe containing data on health service providers.}
}
\value{
The function returns the input dataframe with additional columns including:
\itemize{
  \item `facID`: A renamed variable for facility ID.
  \item `providerID`: A unique identifier for each provider, combining facility ID and provider code.
  \item `year_grad`, `year_startFac`, `year_interview`: Extracted or renamed year variables for graduation, start at facility, and interview year.
  \item `years_atFac`, `years_sinceGrad`: Calculated years of service at the facility and since graduation.
  \item `hoursPerWeek`: Hours worked per week.
  \item Supervision variables: Indicators for supervision received within the last 3 or 6 months.
  \item `supervisionRank`: A rank based on the frequency of supervision visits.
  \item Incentive variables: Indicators for receipt of monetary and non-monetary incentives.
  \item In-service training variables: Indicators for various types of in-service training received.
}
}
\description{
This function preprocesses a dataset of health service providers, adding calculated variables 
and transforming existing ones for easier analysis. It generates unique identifiers for facilities 
and providers, calculates years of experience and service, assesses supervision frequency, 
and identifies receipt of in-service training and incentives.
}
\details{
The function assumes the dataset comes from a standardized survey such as the Service Provision Assessment (SPA). It requires specific variable naming conventions (e.g., `w004` for facility ID). The function is particularly useful for preparing provider data for analyses related to workload, supervision, incentives, and professional development.
