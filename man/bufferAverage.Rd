\title{Calculate Average Raster Values Within Buffer Around Points}
\usage{
bufferAverage(points_sf, raster_obj, radius)
}
\arguments{
\item{points_sf}{An `sf` object containing points.}

\item{raster_obj}{A raster object.}

\item{radius}{The radius within which to calculate the average raster value, in meters.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector containing the average raster value for each point.
}
\description{
This function calculates the average value of raster cells within a specified
radius (buffer) around each point in an `sf` object. The function creates buffers
around each point and then extracts the raster values within these buffers to compute
the average.
}
\examples{
# Assuming points_sf is a predefined sf object and raster is a predefined raster
result <- bufferAverage(points_sf, raster, 1000) # Radius of 1000 meters

}
