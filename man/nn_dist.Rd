\title{Calculate Nearest Neighbor Distance for Each Observation in an sf Object}
\usage{
nn_dist(GEdata)
}
\arguments{
\item{GEdata}{An `sf` object containing the geographic data with coordinates.
The sf object should be properly projected for distance calculation,
ideally in a coordinate system that uses meters (e.g., UTM).}
}
\value{
A numeric vector with the nearest neighbor distances for each observation
        in the `GEdata` sf object. The distances are in the same unit as the sf object's
        coordinate reference system.
}
\description{
This function calculates the Euclidean distance from each observation to its nearest neighbor 
within the same sf object. It returns a vector of distances, with each element representing the 
nearest neighbor distance for the corresponding observation in the sf object.
}
\examples{
# Assuming you have an sf object named GEdata with proper CRS
library(sf)
# Example data creation (you would typically load this from your data source)
GEdata <- st_as_sf(data.frame(id = 1:3,
                              x = c(10, 20, 30),
                              y = c(50, 60, 70),
                              crs = 4326),
                   coords = c("x", "y"), crs = 4326)
# Convert CRS to a more appropriate one for distance measurement
GEdata <- st_transform(GEdata, 32633) # Transforming to a UTM zone

# Calculate nearest neighbor distances
distances <- nn_dist(GEdata)
print(distances)
